A basic, mostly greyscale, modern-looking portfolio template for developers or designers.

## 2) Technologies Utilized

### React

### React Router

### React Hook Form

### EmailJS

### data.js

## 3) Case Study

### About the Project

I needed a portfolio, I purchased this template, and I wanted to challenge myself to recreate it in React.

### Project Execution

The app is composed of React components with the content coming from a configuration file named 'data.js'. The contact form can be configured by creating a '.env' file in the root directory with your EmailJS variables.

### Project Results

The design is modern and smooth on a desktop and loads relatively quickly. It presents itself like a single-page app at first glance, but with some layers revealed upon exploration. The next step is to replace the data configuration file with a db & api.
